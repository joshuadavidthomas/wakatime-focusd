## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- **Multi-desktop support** — wakatime-focusd now works on most Linux desktop environments, not just Hyprland:
  - **Sway** — native IPC tracking for both Wayland and XWayland windows
  - **GNOME Shell** — focus tracking via D-Bus
  - **KDE Plasma** — focus tracking via KWin scripting and D-Bus
  - **Niri** — native IPC tracking via Niri's JSON socket
  - **X11** — generic fallback for any EWMH-compliant window manager (i3, bspwm, awesome, openbox, etc.)
- **Automatic backend detection** — the daemon detects your desktop environment and picks the right backend. No configuration needed in most cases.
- `--backend` CLI flag and `backend` config option for manual override (`auto`, `hyprland`, `sway`, `gnome`, `kde`, `niri`, `x11`)
- `wakatime-focusd config init` command — generates a documented default config file at `~/.config/wakatime-focusd/config.toml` (with `--output` and `--force` options)
- `wakatime-focusd config dump` command — prints the resolved configuration (after CLI overrides) and exits, useful for debugging
- `wakatime-focusd service install` command — generates and installs the systemd user service file, using the current binary path for `ExecStart` (with `--now` to enable/start immediately and `--force` to overwrite)
- `wakatime-focusd service uninstall` command — stops, disables, and removes the systemd user service
- `wakatime-focusd service status` command — shows the service status
- Comprehensive integration test suite covering all backends, the full event pipeline, and reconnection behavior

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `--oneshot` flag replaced by `wakatime-focusd oneshot` subcommand (`--oneshot-count` is now `--count` / `-n`)

### Removed

- `contrib/` directory — the static service file and example config are replaced by the `service install` and `config init` commands

## [0.1.3]

### Fixed

- Unreachable rate-limit warning for wakatime-cli errors (the "showing every Nth error" message could never print)

### Changed

- Removed unnecessary `Arc` wrappers on `IdleMonitor` fields (the struct is always behind `Arc`, so inner `Arc`s were redundant)
- Consolidated duplicated CLI argument construction in heartbeat sending
- Simplified Hyprland socket discovery logic
- Removed dead code: unused `Entity` trait impls, unused import, unused dev-dependency

## [0.1.2]

### Added

- GitHub Actions CI workflows for testing and linting
- GitHub Actions workflows for building and releasing with automated binary artifacts

### Fixed

- Clippy warnings for collapsible if statements, filter_map identity, and struct initialization

## [0.1.1]

### Changed

- **Internal**: Refactored module structure from `mod.rs` pattern to named modules

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Initial implementation of wakatime-focusd daemon with Hyprland backend support
  - Focus detection via Hyprland IPC socket
  - WakaTime heartbeats via `wakatime-cli` (`--entity-type app`)
  - Smart throttling (2-minute rule + focus changes)
  - Idle gating via systemd-logind IdleHint
  - TOML configuration file support
  - CLI options for dry-run, debug, and oneshot modes
  - systemd user service file
- Added glob fallback for Hyprland socket discovery
- Added MIT license
